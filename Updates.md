## November 26, 2018
The save function is being fixed (item properties included this time) and store should work fine now.

## November 25, 2018
We had a lot of crashes related to shop items and a bug with spell purchase (it defaults to Fireball), but we did it; Multiplayer is possible and saving character (with no property yet) is possible.

The problem related to save icon getting stuck on the screen has been fixed and you can see other players who connect to the test server now and play with them up to the point where unimplemented API is used.

The light halo effect that plays when you take control of the land (by interacting with the altar) doesn't play yet.

Permanull is working on implementing the rest of the API; Stay tuned!

## November 20, 2018
Problems were collected:
- Chests do not spawn loot
- Ascending rewards are not selectable
- Autosave is broken and its icon gets stuck on the screen when ascending

Gameplay is possible, but your progress is not saved. (yet)

## November 18, 2018
We made a breakthrough!

However, the game does not work fully past the character creation screen:
