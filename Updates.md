We had a lot of crashes related to shop items and a bug with spell purchase (it defaults to Fireball), but we did it; Multiplayer is possible and saving character (with no property yet) is possible.

Permanull is working on implementing the rest of the API; Stay tuned!

## November 20, 2018
Problems were collected:
- Chests do not spawn loot
- Ascending rewards are not selectable
- Autosave is broken and its icon gets stuck on the screen when ascending

Gameplay is possible, but your progress is not saved. (yet)

We made a breakthrough!

However, the game does not work fully past the character creation screen:
